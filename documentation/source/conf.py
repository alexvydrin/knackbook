# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys
from django import setup as django_setup

# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath('..\\..\\index.rst'))))
os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "knackbook.settings")

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

copyright = '2021, Galina, Evgeniy and  Alex'
author = 'Galina, Evgeniy and  Alex'

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release = '1.0'


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ['_templates']

# The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation
# for a list of supported languages.
#
# This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
# Usually you set "language" from the command line for these cases.
language = 'ru'

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = []


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'alabaster'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
